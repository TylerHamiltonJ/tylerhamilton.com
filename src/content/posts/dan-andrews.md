Using a combination of GPT-2 and GPT-3, I've trained a bot to speak like Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews.

The aim of this project is to showcase the frighteningly advanced capabilities of AI's capabilities of producing human-like text using political satire.

Within the first week of the project, "*Dan Andrews, But AI"* gained over 1,500 likes on Facebook, with an estimated post reach of over 60,000 people.
