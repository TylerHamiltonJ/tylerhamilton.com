How do you combat the rise of political deepfakes during the age of disinformation? Political satire and The Simpsons.

In this project, I've used [Rudrabha's Wav2Lip library](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) to create a series of convincing Deepfakes of famous Australian politicians like Pauline Hanson, Scott Morrison, Daniel Andrews, and Tony Abbott.

This project came during about during the US election when the Trump campaign posted a deepfake of Joe Biden, so the project eventually evolved to include deepfakes of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

Collectively, these deepfakes garnered over 200,000 views on YouTube, and were viewed millions of times across Facebook.
