During COVID-19's second wave in Melbourne, the information on where the current outbreaks were happening was difficult to find, and not presented in a easy to understand way. Most sites aggregated information, and would either display outbreaks by council, or would combine data so a postcode with 1 case would be treated the same as a postcode with 50. This was not a solution that worked for Melbourne's current outbreak and led to the virus rapidly spreading.

Working with CARTO, I created a map that would display outbreaks by size, and coloured them depending on if the outbreak was increasing or decreasing. Using community feedback, this map was later expanded to include information about testing locations, outbreak hotspots, and cases per capita.

Over 10,000 people viewed this map during the August and September outbreaks, and was shared several times on Twitter.
